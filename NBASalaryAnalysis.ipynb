Similarly, this phenomenon also explains why SGs have a negative correlation between their TS%(True Shooting Percentage) and their salaries.

addressing some of the study's limitations would be beneficial. Specifically, incorporating a reputation variable would require developing a scoring system to evaluate player reputations. Additionally, exploring other eras of the NBA, particularly earlier periods when the league was less established and salaries were much lower, could provide valuable insights. Lastly, while our study focuses on many commonly used statistics, examining newer metrics like the LEBRON stat could also yield interesting findings.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"BKqC0_Rz6Lb6"}}]}
